    mobile apps (Ionic / Cordova, iOS, Android), and Chrome Extension.
    Managed dev-ops on Heroku and Amazon Web Services.
    This was a deep-dive into scalability, marketing, fundraising, hiring, and more.
    I managed an open source community of 200+ contributors (github.com/habitrpg/habitrpg).
    Was a one-man-band running this 800k+ user-base for 1.5y before hiring.
    Lots of startup lessons to bear!"
